# Probability Calculator

A React application to help calculate RNG probabilities. True random (or even psuedorandom) does not operate the way the human brain does, but knowing the odds can help. Just enter your probability, in percent, and how many attempts you want to make, and it'll tell you the chances you'll succeed at least once.

random: it's easy for programmers, but hard for the users. There's a lesson in this, I'm sure.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
